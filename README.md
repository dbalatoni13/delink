A splitting tool for decompilation projects.

## Supported Formats:
- Shared Object (.so) files, AArch64 (ELF64) and 32-bit ARM (ELF32), split by
  DWARF compilation units or by [`.symtab` translation units](#elf-splitting).
- Mach-O STABS and SYMTAB
- Windows PE with PDB's (.exe/.pdb).
- Any binary IDA can analyse, via the [IDA import](#ida-import) workflow.

## IDA import

When you don't have debug info but do have an IDA database, you can split using
IDA's analysis. There are two pieces, decoupled by a JSON file so delink never
has to link against IDA:

1. **Export** (inside IDA 9.x). Run [`crates/delink-ida/ida_export.py`](crates/delink-ida/ida_export.py)
   to write a small, human-readable JSON describing the architecture/segment
   layout, every function (boundaries + flags), the full address → name map, and
   the relocations IDA knows (its fixup table **and** offset-typed operands —
   the latter being the only relocation record for images with no `.reloc`,
   e.g. EXEs). Unnamed data targets referenced by those relocations receive
   deterministic `byte_`/`word_`/`dword_`/`qword_` names so they can be edited
   in the exported JSON. The export carries **no bytes**:

   ```shell
   # headless (idat64.exe for a 64-bit database)
   "idat.exe" -A -S"crates\delink-ida\ida_export.py delink.ida.json" database.idb
   ```
   or, interactively, File → Script file… and pick the script.

2. **Import + split** (delink). Pass the JSON **and the original binary** (the
   bytes and the PE `.reloc` table come from there):

   ```shell
   delink ida-split delink.ida.json binary.exe -o ./output
   ```

   For **x86 / x86-64** targets delink disassembles each function with iced-x86
   to recover rel32 call/jump relocations, and combines IDA's relocations with
   the binary's `.reloc` table for absolute pointers, resolving every target
   through the exported name map. Output is COFF `.obj` for PE inputs (use
   `--elf` for ELF `.o`).

   As with the Mach-O splitter, the first run writes an editable `idapro.json`
   grouping into the output directory. Each object can contain explicit
   functions, whole-function ranges, and half-open IDA virtual-address ranges
   from `.rdata`, `.data`, and logical `.bss`:

   ```json
   {
     "example.obj": {
       "functions": [268441600, 268441648],
       "function_ranges": [[268442000, 268443000]],
       "rdata": [[268500992, 268501120]],
       "data": [[268566528, 268566592]],
       "bss": [[268570624, 268571648]]
     }
   }
   ```

   `function_ranges` uses half-open `[start, end)` virtual-address ranges and
   selects every complete function whose bounds fit inside the range. A range
   that cuts through a function is rejected. Assigned `.rdata`/`.data` ranges
   are emitted in that object and removed from `__shared_data.obj`. A `bss`
   range is emitted as zero-filled `.bss`; it can refer to an IDA BSS segment
   or to a BSS tail that IDA reports inside `.data`. The old
   `{ "<obj>": [<function-address>, ...] }` form is still accepted. Function
   and data-symbol metadata always comes from `delink.ida.json`.

## Building

Install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HaydnTrigg/delink.git
cd delink
cargo run --release
```

Or install directly with cargo:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/HaydnTrigg/delink.git delink
```

Binaries will be installed to `~/.cargo/bin` as `delink`.
